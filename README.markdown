Hey All

WG has introduced a lot of different camos over the last couple years. 
Tier ten can be confusing if you haven't kept up with all of the additions, and even in the lower tiers there are tanks that make people go 'um, what?' when they see the battle screen.
Here's hoping this helps....

We  (random SPUDs and buds) have come up with a list of all the camo's that change the name of your tank on the battle screen.
If you're an old hand at Blitz, or really obsessive about these things, give it a review and see if we've missed anything.

I'm considering expanding it to a list of all the various camos, but not sure anybody cares.
